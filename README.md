## **Hangman Game Overview**
- **This is a console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in C++.**  
- The game challenges players to guess the hidden word by guessing individual letters.  
- Players have limited chances to guess incorrectly before the game ends.  
- The goal is to reveal the word and save the hangman character from being "hanged."

3. **Customizable Player Name**:  
   - Players can enter their name, which is displayed throughout the game.  
4. **Hints**:  
   - The game provides a hint indicating the category of the word (animal names).

## **How to Play**
1. **Start the Game**:  
   - Run the program in a C++ IDE or terminal with proper C++ support.  
   - Enter your name when prompted.  
2. **Guess the Word**:  
   - A random word will be selected and displayed as a series of `x` characters (e.g., `xxxxx`).  
   - Guess one letter at a time by typing a character and pressing Enter.  
3. **Hints and Chances**:  
   - You will be told if your guess is correct or incorrect.  
   - The number of incorrect guesses is limited to 3.  
4. **Win or Lose**:  
   - If you guess all letters correctly, you win, and the hangman character is "released."  
   - If you run out of chances, the game ends, and the hangman character is "hanged."  
5. **Replay**:  
   - After each game, you can choose to play again or exit.

## **System Requirements**
- **C++ Compiler**: (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)  
- **Windows OS**: (for compatibility with `windows.h` and `Sleep()` function).

## **Code Highlights**
- **Random Word Selection**:  
   - Utilizes `srand()` and `rand()` for random word generation.  
- **Dynamic ASCII Art**:  
   - Functions (`begin()`, `release()`, `hanged()`, `correct()`, `incorrect()`) update the visual representation of the game state.  
- **Game Loop**:  
   - The main game loop continues until the word is guessed or chances are exhausted.  
- **User Input**:  
   - Players interact through the console by guessing letters.
